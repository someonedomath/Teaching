* Basic Information
***** I am the teaching assistant in the class Advanced in Stochastic processes at Peking University, spring 2019.
***** Here is the Book we use https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/PTE5_011119.pdf.
***** For more information about this class see http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/dayue/Homepage/instruction.html.
* Solutions to the Selected Exercises 
** Solutions to Exercises 6.3.x and 6.2.x
*** Exercise 6.2.1.
    Show tha if $X\in L^p$ with $p>1$ then the convergence in Theorem 6.2.1 occurs in $L^p$.
*** Exercise 6.2.2 
    (1) Show that if $g_n(w) \to g(w)$ a.s. and $E(\sup_k| g_k(w))< \infty$, then \[ \lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{1}{n} \sum_{m=0}^{n-1} g_m(\varphi^m w) = E(g|\mathcal I) \quad a.s. \]
*** Proof:
